## Figure 1: Mouse Edit Distribution (n=100)
**File path:** reports/edit_distributions/figures/edit_distribution_mouse_n100.png

Comprehensive 4-panel analysis of edit distributions for 100 sampled mouse neurons. Top-left histogram shows right-skewed distribution (mean=422 edits, median=354). Top-right bar chart shows balanced merge/split ratio (47%/53%). Bottom-left box plot displays quartiles and percentiles. Bottom-right scatter plot highlights heavy-tail neurons (>964 edits, n=4, 10.6% of edits).

## Figure 2: Mouse Edit Distribution (n=500)
**File path:** reports/edit_distributions/figures/edit_distribution_mouse_n500.png

Comprehensive 4-panel analysis using larger n=500 mouse neuron samples to validate n=100 findings. Top-left histogram shows similar right-skewed distribution (mean=411 edits, median=335). Top-right bar chart confirms nearly balanced merge/split ratio (46.3% merge, 53.7% split). Bottom-left box plot matches n=100 percentiles closely. Bottom-right scatter plot shows 24 heavy-tail neurons (4.8%, 14.1% of edits), validating the heavy-tail pattern and demonstrating sample size stability across Mouse dataset.

## Figure 3: Fly Edit Distribution (n=100)
**File path:** reports/edit_distributions/figures/edit_distribution_fly_n100.png

Comprehensive 4-panel analysis of edit distributions for 100 sampled fly neurons. Top-left histogram shows extreme right-skew with concentration near zero (mean=18 edits, median=8). Top-right bar chart shows merge dominance (72% merge, 28% split). Bottom-left box plot displays tighter quartile range compared to Mouse. Bottom-right scatter plot highlights heavy-tail neurons (>60 edits, n=5, 38% of edits), revealing concentrated proofreading effort in outlier neurons.

## Figure 4: Fly Edit Distribution (n=500 - Validation)
**File path:** reports/edit_distributions/figures/edit_distribution_fly_n500.png

Comprehensive 4-panel analysis using larger n=500 fly neuron samples to validate n=100 findings. Top-left histogram shows similar extreme right-skew (mean=19 edits, median=8). Top-right bar chart confirms strong merge dominance (74% merge, 26% split). Bottom-left box plot matches n=100 percentiles exactly (median=8 across both samples). Bottom-right scatter plot shows 25 heavy-tail neurons (5.0%, 36% of edits), confirming the outlier pattern and demonstrating robust sample consistency across Fly dataset.

## Figure 5: Fly Edit Distribution (n=1000 - Extended Validation)
**File path:** reports/edit_distributions/figures/edit_distribution_fly_n1000.png

Comprehensive 4-panel analysis using extended n=1000 fly neuron samples for robust validation of distribution patterns. Top-left histogram shows consistent extreme right-skew (mean=17.5 edits, median=8). Top-right bar chart confirms strong merge dominance (74% merge, 26% split), demonstrating stability across all Fly sample sizes. Bottom-left box plot shows excellent agreement with n=100 and n=500 samples (median=8 across all three samples, ±6.6% mean variation). Bottom-right scatter plot reveals 47 heavy-tail neurons (4.7%, 33.3% of edits), establishing that Fly proofreading exhibits exceptional consistency across all sample sizes and that heavy-tail neurons systematically account for ~1/3 of total editing effort despite representing only ~5% of neurons.
